# UnityForDummies
This is a unity guide for bug fixing, issues and etc.
If you found another fix or something you want added, email alecleseman@gmail.com

# Creating your first project
Assuming you have [unity](https://unity.com) installed.
Create a new project, for this guide we are using 2D, so click on 2D.


# Common security problems
Please don't publish a game with a security issue, update your unity version to the newest.
Unity had a recent problem with security with some versions, update to the f2 version or you might encounter lots of bugs

# Unity editor bugs
I've encountered one single bug with the ui/inspector, it hides stuff and cant access giving you a bunch of errors, like you can't access the inspector with lists and stuff because its blank
This is not a skill issue, its unity being crappy.
How to fix - Go to preferences and go to editor, Then set IMGUI to true.
This usually fixes the problems.
If your having some issues with that, and you found a fix, please email me.



# Use documentation
[Unity documentation](https://docs.unity.com/en-us) is the best use case for finding what a method did and finding methods. Like OnTriggerEnter2D, Maybe you forgot the name or how to use it. Dont watch a tutorial.
