# Getting out of tutorial hell
Tutorial hell is basically when YOU watch too MANY tutorials without being able to actually code anything.
Please stop using more tutorials and just doing the exact same thing.
How to fix - Change it up, Without out a tutorial. Create new lines, maybe you want it to do this method instead of another.
Eg. I want to use overlap circles instead of ontriggers.
